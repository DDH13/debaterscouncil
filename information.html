                <div class="tab-content">

                    Organizing a debate tournament is a complex task, and we recommend getting the aid of a
                    person with prior tournament organizing experience in order to ensure a smooth event. The
                    process can be streamlined into to a sequence of structured steps as outlined below.
                    <br><br>

                        <li>Obtain Permissions<br>
                            <p>
                                Seek the necessary permissions from relevant authorities within your educational
                                institution to host an event. Obtain official clearance to organize the
                                tournament on your school premises.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                Initiate the process by sending a formal email to our organization, requesting
                                endorsement for the tournament. In your email, kindly provide details about the
                                scale of the tournament and the proposed dates for the event.
                                Please note that tournaments should not be organized on public holidays or on
                                consecutive weekends.
                                If a tournament by another institution is already scheduled to be held the week
                                prior or following your proposed dates kindly consider rescheduling.

                            <p>
                                Extend formal invitations to all member schools associated with The Debaters'
                                Council. The emails can be found in the DC schools registry. The school
                                representative in the Tournament Coordination WhatsApp group is requested to
                                share the invitation and registration link within the WhatsApp group as well.

                            <p>
                                Extend invitations to experienced and qualified adjudicators for the tournament.
                                While institutional judges undoubtedly contribute valuable expertise, we
                                emphasize the importance of broadening the judging pool to ensure robustness and
                                avoid over-dependence.
                                Furthermore, it is important to establish a Core Adjudication Panel (CAP) which
                                usually consists of 1-3 veteran adjudicators. The CAP is responsible for
                                allocating judges, solving disputes, setting motions, issuing motion
                                clarifications, and other such tasks.

                                Submit the proposed debate motions to the DC Motions Committee for approval by
                                sending an email to <a href="mailto: dcmotionscommittee" target="_blank">

                            </a>. These motions should be submitted at least two weeks prior to the scheduled
                                tournament.

                                Utilize Tabbycat for tabulation throughout the tournament. It is imperative to
                                adhere rigorously to all regulations and guidelines set forth by The Debaters'
                                Council at all stages of tabulation.
